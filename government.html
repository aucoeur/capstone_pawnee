                <p>My name is Bill Dexhart, and I would first like to make one thing clear: I have no plans to resign. I
                    pride myself on being available to the public, and taking the hands-on approach to get things done.
                    I am a member of many important committees, working to better the community with single mothers,
                    nurses, waitresses, yoga instructors… the list continues.</p>
                <p>
                    When I was voted in to City Council, I took a personal oath (that I wrote myself) in which I pledged
                    that I would not leave office until each individual citizen of Pawnee is satisfied. So, you tell me,
                    are you satisfied? If you know what I am referring to, call me anytime, stop by my office or we can
                    meet at one of the multiple locations provided on my outgoing voicemail. Or bathrooms in any of our
                    public parks, recreational facilities or local businesses. Again, I have no plans to resign.</p>

                <p>Jeremy Jamm, D.D.S. is a staple in the community and has provided Pawnee with a reason to smile since
                    he opened the doors of Jamm Orthodontia in 1999. Orthodontics is sometimes referred to as an
                    elective treatment, but next time you hear someone say that, do yourself a favor and look at the
                    mouth it’s coming out of. Disgusting, right? Don’t let that mouth happen to you.</p>
                <p>
                    As a member of City Council, Dr. Jamm is in it for himself: the “himself” in everyone. He relates.
                    With all the problems facing this town and its citizens, Jeremy Jamm lies in bed every night and
                    sleeps a sound eight hours, just dreaming. And his dreams have come true.</p>

                <p>Pawnee runs in my veins. I was born here*. I grew up here. I was educated here. I made friends here.
                    I fell off my bike here and scraped my knee here. I ate my first waffle here (thanks, JJ!) – and
                    will eat my last one here, too. I fell in love here. I work here. I live here. 24 hours a day, I
                    live for Pawnee.</p>
                <p> I look around and see all the wonderful things we can still do. We can create more parks – lush,
                    green places for all of us to relax and play and grow. We can make our schools better, our sidewalks
                    safer, and our libraries fewer. We can create more jobs. We can finally repave Grand Avenue. (Can
                    you imagine that? Driving down Grand Ave. without the fear of blowing out a tire?) We can even
                    eliminate our raccoon problem**.</p>
                <p>
                    I want to lead this great city into the future. I can see its future as clearly as you read this
                    sentence, right now, in this moment.</p>
                <p>
                    I’m Leslie Knope, and I’m running for City Council in Pawnee, Indiana.</p>
                <p>
                    *Yes, okay, fine, technically I was born in Eagleton. Nice work, smartypants. The point is, I have
                    lived in Pawnee all my life, and I love it.</p>
                <p>
                    **Truth be told, we probably cannot ever eliminate our raccoon problem. I know I’m supposed to just
                    make that campaign promise, like every politician does, but let’s be honest – those suckers aren’t
                    going anywhere.</p>

                <p>I am Fielding Milton. I fought and defeated the Japanese in World War II. Since being elected to City
                    Council in 1948, as part of the Dixiecrat Party, I’ve always had the Pawnee citizens’ best interests
                    in mind. Of course, in my time, the only people recognized as Pawnee citizens were white males over
                    the age of 17. Throughout my term, I have done a lot. I founded the committee to lower the minimum
                    age limit of immigrant workers to eight; I am a member of the Committee to Preserve the Pawnee
                    Japanese Interment Camp Museum, and I am also the chairman and only member of the Committee to
                    Re-convert the Pawnee Japanese Internment Camp Museum Back into a Working Internment Camp.</p>
                <p>
                    My children, may they rest in peace, have given me three beautiful grandchildren, who have given me
                    eight great-grandchildren. Family is important to me, and our country is important to me; and I hope
                    to bring us back to exactly the way things were when our country was founded, or perhaps earlier.
